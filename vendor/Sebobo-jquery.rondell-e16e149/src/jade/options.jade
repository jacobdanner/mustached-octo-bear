          Set *once* to true if the rondell should not start autorotation after the user has hovered the rondell.

          *preventDefaults* will prevent clicking and scrolling while your swipe.
          
          *threshold* is the distance in pixels the finger has to travel, before a swipe is registered.
      
    tr
      td theme
      td default
      td
        :markdown
          Theme which will be used for the rondell.
          
          The rondell css file already includes some themes:
          *default, light, dark, page*

          Take a look at the *jquery.rondell.css* if you want to customize a theme.

      td -
      td
        :markdown
          The plugin contains some presets for the options to help you get started with your own rondell.
          
          The current presets are based on the examples on this page and include:
          
          *carousel, products, pages, cubic, gallery, thumbGallery*

    tr
      td randomStart
      td false
      td Will select a random item to start with.

    tr
      td
        :markdown
          funcLeft

          funcTop

          funcOpacity

          funcSize

          funcDiff
      td see presets source
      td
        :markdown
          These functions will be called by the plugin when animating the rondell items.
          
          At first *funcDiff* is called for each item with the absolute distance from the center 
          item to calculate the relative distance between the items. The second parameter is 
          the rondell object itself.

          The return value will be used to call the other four functions. Each with the new relative distance
          as first parameter and the rondell object as second parameter.
          
          The rondell object can be used to access all of the options in the rondell.
          I will provide an in-depth tutorial at a later date. In the meantime please use the advanced examples as a
          base for your own customization or send me a message and I'll try to help.

        :markdown
          When the plugin has finished loading it will automatically 
          show the parent of the items you selected.

          This is for removing the glitch when the plugin takes to long to load and all your items
          are shown one under another.
          
          You should set the css of your items container to *display:none*.
